Examples
========

This directory contains everything needed for my Linear Algebra test 1.

To re-run these examples
 
 1. See the `classlist.txt` file, a sample class roster, with one student per line. 
 2. See the `test1.tex` for my test 1 for Linear Algebra.  It was compiled to `test1.pdf` using `pdflatex` twice.
 3. See the `test1-rubric.tex` for my test 1 for Linear Algebra.  It was compiled to `test1-rubric.pdf` using `pdflatex` twice.
 4. See the `'test1-coversheets.tex` and `test1-codes.tsv`.  They were made with `python ../makecodes.py classlist.txt test1-coversheets.tex test1-codes.tsv`
 5. View the coversheets at `test1-coversheets.pdf`.  They were compiled with `pdflatex test1-coversheets.tex`.
